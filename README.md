Due to the increasing popularity of NoSQL systems, there is an urgent need to introduce the topic in computer
science and information systems undergraduate curriculum. These systems are characterized by a variety of
database models and vendor implementations, each with its own specific query language, particularities, and
application niches. For these reasons, it has become increasingly evident that teaching NoSQL requires a more
creative, project­based learning approach; one that instigates students’ curiosity and urges them to seek knowledge by themselves. This paper describes two NoSQL projects that use real­world datasets crafted from Twitter; they can be easily adapted and assigned to students taking an introductory course in database systems to help them learn NoSQL quickly with an engaging approach.
